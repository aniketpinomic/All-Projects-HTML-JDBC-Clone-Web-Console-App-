    <h2> How To Make? </h2>
    <a Id="Procedure">
    <ol>
        <li> <h3><b> Prepare the filling for Puran Poli </b></h3></li></a>
        <pre> Put a saucepan over medium flame and add ghee to it. Once the ghee is melted, add blanched dal in it.
            Roast for 2-3 minutes and then add jaggery, ginger powder, cardamom powder, fennel powder and nutmeg powder into it. 
            Mix all the ingredients and cook the dal for another 2-3 minutes. Once done, turn off the flame and let it cool. 
            Then mash the dal using a masher.</pre>
        
    
        <li> <h3><b> Knead the dough </b></h3></li>
        <PRe> In a dough kneading plate, add all-purpose flour, turmeric, salt to taste and refined oil.
            Mix well and then add a little water at a time and knead to make a stiff dough. 
            Divide the dough into 3 parts and keep it aside.</PRe>


        <li><h3> <b> Make Puran Polis </b></h3></li>
        <pre> Take one part and press it a little to make space in the centre. Once done, take the chana-jaggery mixture 
            and fill it in the centre. Close and shape again like a ball. Grease your hands a little and make roti with your hands. 
            You can roll it out using a rolling pin too.</pre>


        <li><b> <h3> Cook the Puran Polis </h3></b></li>
        <pre> Put a tawa on medium flame and place the roti on it. Add 1/2 teaspoon ghee and cook well from both sides.
            Serve hot or pair with tea or coffee.</pre>
    </ol>



    <h2> Tips for You.....! </h2>
    <a Id="tips">tips </a>
    <ul type="circle"> 
        <li> Soak chana dal for 30 minutes before you pressure cook it so that it is evenly cooked. </li></a>
        <li> If you don't want to use sugar, you can also use powdered or grated jaggery. It is a healthier choice than processed refined sugar. </li>
        <li> Mash the dal and jaggery mixture very well using a potato masher. No chana dal should be left unmashed in the stuffing as it will be difficult to roll out thin Puran Polis.</li>
        <li> Knead a soft dough. You can use half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour too.</li>
        <li> Apply ghee on the Puran Poli only when the golden brown spots appear while toasting. This will give the dish a crispy texture. </li>
